# Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection

Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) represents a new generation of land cover mapping and change monitoring from the U.S. Geological Surveyâ€™s Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. LCMAP answers a need for higher quality results at greater frequency with additional land cover and change variables than previous efforts. [The USGS website for LCMAP is here.](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/lcmap)

Collection 1.3 of the LCMAP product contains 10 different science products ([details here](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/lcmap/collection-13-conus-science-products)).

To accelerate your access to this dataset, the ESIIL team has made LCMAP 1.3 Primary Land Cover product (LCPRI) data for the Southern Rockies available on the Cyverse data store at the below directory:

```
~/data-store/data/iplant/home/shared/earthlab/forest_carbon_codefest/LCMAP_SR_1985_2021
```

Additional LCMAP layers and products may be accessed via STAC and VSI.

The script used to download the LCMAP data already available is located in the GitHub repo at /code/create-data-library/LCMAP_Direct_Access-adapted.ipynb. The code is from the LCMAP data access tutorial.

# TreeMap

TreeMap 2016 is a USFS tree-level model of the forests of the conterminous United States created by using machine learning algorithms to match forest plot data from Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) to a 30x30 meter (m) grid.

The main output of this project is a raster map of imputed plot identifiers at 30Ã—30 m spatial resolution for the conterminous U.S. for landscape conditions circa 2016. The plot identifiers can be associated with data from FIA plots held in the associated csv and SQL files.

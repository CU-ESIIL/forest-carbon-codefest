# Breakout prompts

For ease of access to breakout group prompts throughout the codefest.

## Breakout #1: Virtual meeting #3

Introduce yourselves! Please briefly share:

 - Your preferred name and where you are currently based
 - A skill or area of expertise that you feel you are bringing to the table
 - Something you are worried about regarding the codefest
 - Something non-work-related that brings you joy

Brainstorm and discuss:

 - What is a topic that you, as a team, are excited to investigate for two days related to forest carbon in the Southern Rocky mountains?
   - What datasets are you excited to potentially use?

*(Tuesday morning you will have ~2.5 hours to continue brainstorming, with a draft question ready by noon! So don't stress, this is just a first opportunity to get a sense of what your team is generally excited about.)*

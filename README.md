# Undisturbed GEDIs

Welcome to the **Undisturbed GEDIs** repository, an integral part of ESIIL and Earth Lab's Forest Carbon Codefest. This repository is the central hub for our team, encompassing our project overview, team member information, codebase, and more...

## Our Project
Our project aims to bridge the gap between the spatially abundant but lower-resolution GLAD ARD (Global Land Analysis and Discovery Analysis Ready Data) and the higher-resolution but sparser GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) LiDAR dataset. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as gradient boosted regression, Light GBM, and XGBoost, we seek to develop a unified model capable of producing wall-to-wall maps that combine the strengths of both datasets. This integrated approach will enhance our ability to monitor and analyze global land cover changes, providing valuable insights into forest structure, biomass estimation, and ecosystem dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales.

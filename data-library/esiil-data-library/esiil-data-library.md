# ESIIL Data Libraries

ESIIL has compiled additional data libraries for use at summits and hackathons. Link to those data libraries are available here, along with a summary of their current contents (February 2024).

## General ESIIL Data Library

[Our data library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/data-library/) features a diverse range of datasets, each with its own dedicated web page. To help you get started, we provide easy-to-use R and Python code snippets for downloading and working with each dataset. For more advanced users, we also offer comprehensive tutorials and vignettes tailored to individual datasets. Explore our rich collection and unlock the power of environmental data for your research today!

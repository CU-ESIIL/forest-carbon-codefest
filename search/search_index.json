For years, scientists have\u00a0 conducted complex research and disseminated their findings via scientific journals. However, in this process, the overall message scientists aim to communicate can often be misunderstood or altogether ignored due to the complex language used to explain their research (Opermanis et al. 2015). This significantly hinders the scientific method because it cuts off the final step: communicating results. There is no use in doing science at all if one\u2019s findings are incomprehensible. \u201cIt is important to stay fluid as to how research can be communicated,\u201d said Erin Espelie, co-director of NEST. Through storytelling and creative representations of data, art-science collaborations seek to bridge this gap by creating emotional connection. In the context of environmental science, these connections can encourage sustainable actions and mindsets.\u00a0</p> <p>Presenting the facts alone is less likely to result in long-term changes in feelings and behavior (Jacobson et al. 2007). However, these behavioral changes are key to solving many of our environmental problems. Art has the unique power to touch the heart and mind of an individual to inspire meaningful change. For example, art can create an intrinsic appreciation of nature, ultimately motivating people\u2019s willingness to protect it (Carr 2004). Today, fewer generations are coming in direct contact with nature, instead experiencing the outdoors more vicariously through cinema, television, photography, and other forms. These visual art forms can expose audiences to the beautiful and practical values of our natural resources. Art-science collaborations can amplify this message by providing an emotional connection to the scientific results, ultimately reaching more diverse audiences and communicating more effectively (Curtis et al. 2014).</p> <p>Conservation work, in particular, deals with complex problems such as biodiversity loss, pollution, and deforestation that require innovative solutions. Transdisciplinary approaches can encourage both artists and scientists to strive for innovation within their work. Beauty/art can have meaning, and research can be communicated in a more personal way (Clark et al. 2020). While the Forest Carbon Codefest Artist-in-Attendance program was one of ESIIL/Earth Lab\u2019s first art-science collaborations, many of our members also identify as artists in addition to their scientific identities; scientists are also poets, painters, potters, musicians, and photographers. The artistic and scientific pursuits of our members inform one another, leading to new insights and discoveries. These insights are enhanced when generated by creative collaboration.</p> <p>Ultimately, uniting the disciplines of art and data science will be essential to solving interwoven social-ecological problems during this period of global environmental change. This initiative was a first opportunity to expose scientists at ESIIL/Earth Lab events and artists sponsored through NEST to new avenues of art-science transdisciplinary approaches. We look forward to creating future collaborations in which there is a bidirectional flow of ideas between art and science. In the meantime, come check out the art in person, located in ESIIL!</p>"},{"location":"artist-in-attendance/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Carr, D. (2004).

Both allow for filtering, transforming, and aggregating data frames. The syntax for performing these operations is slightly different between the two languages, with R using the %&gt;% operator for chaining operations and Python using method chaining or the apply family of functions.</p> <p>One key difference between the two languages is that R\u2019s tidyverse provides a consistent grammar for data manipulation across its various packages, making it easier to learn and use. However, Python\u2019s pandas library has a larger developer community and is more versatile for use in other applications, such as web development or machine learning.</p> <p>In conclusion, both R and Python provide powerful tools for data wrangling, and the choice between the two ultimately depends on the specific needs of the user and their familiarity</p>"},{"location":"additional-resources/bilingualism_md/#data-from-api","title":"Data from API","text":"<p>Retrieving data from an API is a common task in both R and Python.

Here\u2019s an example of how to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API in R:</p> <p>R code:</p> <pre><code>library(httr)\n\nurl &lt;- 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&amp;appid=API_KEY'\n\nresponse &lt;- GET(url)\n\ndata &lt;- content(response, 'text')\n\nprint(data)\n</code></pre> <p>This code is similar to the Python code above. We first load the httr library, then construct the API URL and use the GET() function to make a request to the API. We then extract the data from the response using the content() function and print the resulting data.</p> <p>Retrieving Data from an API in R Tidyverse In R Tidyverse, we can use the httr and jsonlite packages to retrieve and process data from an API.</p> <p>R code:</p> <pre><code># Load required packages\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\n# Define API endpoint\nendpoint &lt;- \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\"\n\n# Retrieve data from API\nresponse &lt;- GET(endpoint)\n\n# Extract content from response\ncontent &lt;- content(response, \"text\")\n\n# Convert content to JSON\njson &lt;- fromJSON(content)\n\n# Convert JSON to a data frame\ndf &lt;- as.data.frame(json)\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, we use the GET() function from the httr package to retrieve data from an API endpoint, and the content() function to extract the content of the response. We then use the fromJSON() function from the jsonlite package to convert the JSON content to a list, and the as.data.frame() function to convert the list to a data frame.</p> <p>Retrieving Data from an API in Python In Python, we can use the requests library to retrieve data from an API, and the json library to process the JSON data.</p> <p>Python code:</p> <pre><code># Load required libraries\nimport requests\nimport json\n\n# Define API endpoint\nendpoint = \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\"\n\n# Retrieve data from API\nresponse = requests.get(endpoint)\n\n# Extract content from response\ncontent = response.content\n\n# Convert content to JSON\njson_data = json.loads(content)\n\n# Convert JSON to a list of dictionaries\ndata = [dict(row) for row in json_data]\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, we use the get() function from the requests library to retrieve data from an API endpoint, and the content attribute to extract the content of the response. We then use the loads() function from the json library to convert the JSON content to a list of dictionaries.</p> <p>Comparison Both R Tidyverse and Python provide powerful tools for retrieving and processing data from an API. In terms of syntax, the two languages are somewhat similar. In both cases, we use a library to retrieve data from the API, extract the content of the response, and then process the JSON data. However, there are some differences in the specific functions and methods used. For example, in R Tidyverse, we use the content() function to extract the content of the response, whereas in Python, we use the content attribute. Additionally, in R Tidyverse, we use the fromJSON() function to convert the JSON data to a list, whereas in Python, we use the loads() function.</p>"},{"location":"additional-resources/bilingualism_md/#census-data","title":"Census data","text":"<p>Retrieving USA census data in R, R Tidy, and Python can be done using different packages and libraries.

Here, the data cube creator, much like Adams with his careful dodging and burning, harmonizes disparate elements into a cohesive whole, each decision reflecting an intention and vision for the final product.</p>"},{"location":"data-library/stac_mount_save/#1-the-rat-through-the-snake-problem-scalability-with-cloud-computing","title":"1) The Rat through the Snake Problem: Scalability with Cloud Computing","text":"<p>Just like a snake that swallows a rat, traditional computing systems often struggle to process the large volumes of environmental data \u2014 they\u2019re constrained by their static hardware limitations.

Art that integrates with and elevates our daily surroundings could offer a fresh perspective on the mundane.</p> <p>Nature in the Workplace: On a personal note, I find that art which brings elements of the outdoors inside can create a serene and motivating atmosphere, conducive to the values of sustainability that ESIIL embodies.</p> <p>Interactive Art: I believe that art installations which invite interaction or present a playful exaggeration of reality can energize our space. They have the potential to foster a creative dialogue among the team and with visitors.</p> <p>Dimensionality and Engagement: From my viewpoint, art that breaks out of the traditional two-dimensional space and engages with the viewer in three dimensions can transform the feel of an office. Such dynamic pieces could encourage innovative thinking and collaboration.</p> <p>Art with a Message: It\u2019s my opinion that the art we choose should subtly reflect our collective social and environmental commitments. Pieces that prompt introspection about our role in larger societal issues could resonate well with our team\u2019s ethos.</p> <p>Community Connection: Lastly, I feel that our office should not just be a place for work but also a space that invites community interaction. Art can be a bridge between ESIIL and the public, making our office a hub for inspiration and engagement.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"resources/citations/","title":"Citation Management and Notes Collection in Markdown","text":""},{"location":"resources/citations/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This document serves as a guide for managing citations and collecting research notes for our project.
